High Priority: <br>
-Storing refresh token in a file. <br>
-Realtime character tracking using CREST<br>
-Multithreading implementation (or at least a progress bar) to prevent the GUI from hanging when plotting new courses. <br>
-Implementing additional error-handling. <br>
-Extended path planning by stitching multiple paths together end-to-end.
<p>
