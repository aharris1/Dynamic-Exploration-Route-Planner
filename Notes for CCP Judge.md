-This is the first program that I've distributed and licensed.
-This project uses libraries licensed under Apache 2.0, which had slightly confusing terms, 
 so if I improperly handled the licensing side please let me know and I'll be happy to fix it.
-This project also contains heavily modified code from the [eve-crest OAuthHelper.java class](https://bitbucket.org/evanova/eve-crest/src/2f847da12f9bbb4c54d75960e2925180335d59fc/src/main/java/com/tlabs/eve/crest/net/OAuthHelper.java)
